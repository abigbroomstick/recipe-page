## Overview
This is a front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. The task is to build out a recipe page and to make it as similar as possible to the original design.

## My process
I started by visualizing and structuring the HTML so that each section is logically organized. I then styled the page using CSS and color scheme provided in the style guide, focusing on making it responsive and looking as close as possible to the design photos.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

By tackling this challenge, I learned how to use grid more effectively and especially familiarizing myself with tables and lists as I haven't got many opportunities using them.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<section class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Salt, to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
          <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <section class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><span class="bold">Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
            You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
            the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Add fillings (optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
            middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Fold and serve:</span> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
            fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <section class="nutrition">
        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>The table below shows nutritional values per serving without the additional fillings.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td data-cell="nutrient">Calories</td>
            <td data-cell="nutrient-value"><span class="bold">277kcal</span></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td data-cell="nutrient">Carbs</td>
            <td data-cell="nutrient-value"><span class="bold">0g</span></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td data-cell="nutrient">Protein</td>
            <td data-cell="nutrient-value"><span class="bold">20g</span></td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="no-divider">
            <td data-cell="nutrient">Fat</td>
            <td data-cell="nutrient-value"><span class="bold">22g</span></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  table {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    margin-top: 1rem;
}

[data-cell= "nutrient-value"] {
    color: var(--Nutmeg);
}

tr {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    padding: 0.75rem;
}

tr:not(.no-divider) {
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--Light-Grey);
}

[data-cell= "nutrient"], [data-cell= "nutrient-value"] {
    padding-left: 1.5rem;
}
}
```
### Continued development

I want to learn more javascript to integrate it to this project and maybe build out the full website some day. 

### Useful resources

- [Two simple layouts that work better with Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1IitKbJRFE&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjPv5tfS82UF_iQgFp4Bl998&index=14) - Kevin Powell's channel has helped me tremendously when I started learning how to use CSS Gride. I really liked it and will use it going forward.
